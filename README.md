Telecom Churn Analysis and Prediction
=====================================

Overview
--------

This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn in the telecom sector using machine learning techniques. Customer churn is when customers stop using a company's services, which can have a significant financial impact. By identifying factors contributing to churn, companies can take proactive measures to retain customers.

Project Goals
-------------

1.  **Analyze churn patterns**: Understand key factors leading to customer churn using exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2.  **Build predictive models**: Use machine learning algorithms to predict churn probability for customers.
3.  **Provide actionable insights**: Help telecom companies identify areas of improvement and reduce churn rates.

Dataset
-------

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

*   **Customer demographics**: Gender, age, income, etc.
*   **Account information**: Tenure, monthly charges, contract type, etc.
*   **Service usage**: Internet service type, additional services, customer support calls, etc.
*   **Churn status**: Whether the customer has churned (binary target variable).

The data is cleaned, preprocessed, and stored in the project notebook.

Features of the Project
-----------------------

*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    
    *   Visualizations to highlight churn patterns.
    *   Statistical summaries and feature correlations.
*   **Data Preprocessing**:
    
    *   Handling missing values and outliers.
    *   Feature encoding for categorical variables.
    *   Feature scaling for numerical variables.
*   **Machine Learning Models**:
    
    *   Logistic Regression.
    *   Decision Trees and Random Forest.
    *   Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).
    *   Neural Networks (optional, depending on complexity).
*   **Evaluation Metrics**:
    
    *   Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.
    *   ROC-AUC for binary classification.

Tools and Libraries
-------------------

The project utilizes the following tools and libraries:

*   **Python**: Primary programming language.
*   **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code execution.
*   **Libraries**:
    *   Data manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
    *   Data visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
    *   Machine learning: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`
    *   Evaluation: `sklearn.metrics`
